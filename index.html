                <h3>Where I'm from</h3>
                <p>I was born in the North of England, at the edges of the Lake District. At a young age the family moved to the Northern <span>"City of steel" - Sheffield</span>. This became my hometown and despite many periods working abroad, is the place I've always returned to.</p>

                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>I'm an aspiring <span>Developer</span>. My previous career has been one of a <span>Chef</span>. The change is quite dramatic but actually there are a lot of comparisons between working with food versus Tech and development, it's just that one is in the digital world whilst the other is the tangible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I enjoy writing but don't make enough time for it. I have lots of opinions and can be pretty verbose so it would probably make me easier to be around, plus I would get better at brevity, if I wrote more. I still deeply love food and cooking but I also love spending time outdoors with my partner - anything from hiking to skiing, cycling, climbing, surfing, acrchery etc.</p>
